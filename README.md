# SMS-Studio
Tool to send bulk SMS via a phone connected to the COM port using AT commands. Written in FreeBASIC.

The primary advantage of this code is that it helps users send bulk messages from a personal phone number.

The project has two code snippets:

1. To send a single messages to multiple users 
2. To send multiple messages to the same number (Mainly useful in pranking friends :P )
